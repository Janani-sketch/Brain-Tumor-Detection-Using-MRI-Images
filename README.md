**Brain Tumor Detection from MRI Images**

**Overview**

This project aims to enhance the accuracy of brain tumor detection and classification from MRI images by using a hybrid deep learning model that incorporates multiple Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The hybrid model is designed to leverage the strengths of different CNN architectures to improve the precision and accuracy of detecting and classifying brain tumors.

**Data Collection**
